## Runter
Runter is a task runner for Ruby.
The general idea is it exposes a modular way of performing tasks when a file or file(s) in your project are modified.

# Usage
```
gem install runter
runter init
```

From there simply edit the Runtfile in your project to contain the actions you wish to execute when files are modified.

To start the monitor, type
```
runter
```
